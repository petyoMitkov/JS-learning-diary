/*    Parse the Employee Data
Write a JS function that validates employee data, and stores it if it is valid. The 
employee data consists of 3 elements â€“ employee name, employee salary and employee
position.
The input comes as an array of strings. Each element represents input employee data. 
You should capture only the valid from them. The input will have the following format:
{employeeName} - {employeeSalary} - {employeePosition}
The Employee name will be a string, which can contain only English alphabet letters and
must start with a capital. The Employee salary should be a VALID number. The employee
position can contain English alphabet letters, digits, dashes, and can consist of several
words. Any input that does NOT follow the specified above rules, is to be treated as
invalid, and is to be ignored.
The output should be printed on the console. For every valid employee data found, you
should print each of its elements. Check the examples.

Examples:
Input
Jonathan - 2000 - Manager
Peter- 1000- Chuck
George - 1000 - Team Leader 

Output
Name: Jonathan
Position: Manager
Salary: 2000
Name: George
Position: Team Leader
Salary: 1000
