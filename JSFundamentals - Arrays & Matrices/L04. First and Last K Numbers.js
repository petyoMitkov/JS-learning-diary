/*  First and Last K Numbers
Write a JS function that prints the first k and the last k elements from an 
array of numbers.
The input comes as array of string elements holding numbers. The first element
represents the number k, all other elements are from the array that needs to
be processed.
The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line print the
first k elements, separated by space. On the second line print the last k 
elements, separated by space.

Examples
Input                  Output       
['2',                  7 8
 '7', '8', '9']        8 9  

['3',                  6 7 8
 '6', '7', '8', '9']   7 8 9    
 */

function firstAndLastK(arr){
    let k = Number(arr.shift());
    console.log(arr.slice(0, k).join(" "));
    console.log(arr.slice(arr.length - k, arr.length ).join(" "));
}
firstAndLastK(["2", "7", "8", "9"]);
