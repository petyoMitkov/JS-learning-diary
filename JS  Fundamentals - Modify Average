/*	Modify Average
Write a JS program that modifies a number until the average value of all of 
its digits is higher than 5. In order to modify the number, your program 
should append a 9 to the end of the number, when the average value of all of 
its digits is higher than 5 the program should stop appending. If the number’s average
value of all of its digits is already higher than 5, no appending should be done.
The input is a single number received as an array of strings.
The output should consist of a single number - the final modified number which
has an average value of all of its digits higher than 5. The output should be
printed on the console.
Constraints
•	The input number will consist of no more than 6 digits.
•	The input will be a valid number (there will be no leading zeroes).
Examples
Input	Output
[101]	1019999
[5835]	5835
