/*    Sum by Town
Youâ€™re tasked with calculating the total sum of income for a number of Towns. 
You will receive an array of strings representing towns and their incomes, every 
even index will be a town and every odd index will be an income belonging to that 
town. Create an object that will hold all the towns as keys and their total income 
(the sum of their incomes) as values to those keys and print it as a JSON. 
The input comes as an array of strings - each even index is the name of a town and 
each odd index is an income belonging to that town. 
The output should be printed on the console - JSON representation of the object 
containing all towns and their total incomes.

Examples:
Input          Output
Sofia          '{"Sofia":25,"Varna":7}'
20
Varna
3
Sofia
5
Varna
4

        let income = Number(arr[row + 1]);
        if (sum[town] == undefined)
            sum[town] = income;
        else
            sum[town] += income;
